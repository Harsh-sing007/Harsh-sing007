## A short introduction (worth reading)

I’m a **Cloud Computing student** who didn’t fall in love with coding overnight.

I struggled with it.
I questioned myself.
And then I stayed.

What changed things for me was not motivation — it was **understanding**.  
Once I started seeing how systems connect, how decisions compound, and how small improvements stack over time, building became addictive.

This space is a **living record** of that journey.

## What I actually care about

I’m interested in problems that sit **between theory and reality**:

- How cloud systems behave under real constraints  
- How AI tools can be *controlled*, not just used  
- How frontend interfaces shape how intelligence is consumed  
- How fundamentals (OS, networks, data flow) quietly power everything  

I don’t rush to frameworks.
I try to understand *why things exist* before depending on them.

## How I approach learning

<details>
<summary><strong>📘 1. Learn the fundamentals first</strong></summary>

Before touching tools, I try to understand:
- what problem is being solved  
- what assumptions are being made  
- what trade-offs exist  

This applies equally to cloud services, AI models, and web frameworks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 2. Build small, complete systems</strong></summary>

I prefer projects that go end-to-end:
- interface → logic → deployment  
- not just demos, but usable systems  

Even simple projects teach a lot when taken seriously.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧠 3. Reflect and refine</strong></summary>

I revisit my own code.
I question earlier decisions.
I refactor when something feels unclear.

Progress, for me, is iterative.

## What you’ll find in my repositories

- Cloud deployment experiments (AWS, Vercel)
- AI-assisted tools and workflows
- Academic concepts translated into code
- Projects that prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Gradual improvement rather than sudden polish

Some repositories may look simple.  
That’s intentional.
